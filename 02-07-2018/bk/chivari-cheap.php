        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>&quot;Where can I find <strong>Cheap Chiavari Chairs</strong>? Aren't all <strong>Chiavari Chairs </strong>the same?&quot; This is a common anthem to the buying process, and sure, it's easy to find Cheap and low-priced Chiavari Chairs on  the internet. BUT....</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>To make a cheaper chair, you need to cut corners in order to produce them as fast and as cheaply as possible. </p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p><strong>But cutting corners sacrifices quality and safety!</strong> Why would you want that?</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <h2 class="page_head2">A Great Balance Between Cost and Quality</h2>
        <div class="float_l">
        <p>Over the past 8 years we have worked almost <em>exclusively</em> with Chiavari Chairs.</p>
        <p>Our experience with various factories through the years coupled with our own sense of responsibility to our clients has caused us to develop a unique way to produce very high quality chairs at an affordable price.</p></div>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <h3 class="page_head3">Our chairs:</h3>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Require less maintenance and upkeep over time</li>
            <li>Stay sturdier for longer</li>
            <li>Come with our 1-year limited warranty on chair structure</li>
            <li>Pass our 12-Point Quality Assurance Inspection before going through our door to you</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <h2 class="page_head2">We Set A New Standard</h2>
        <div class="float_l">
        <p>&quot;Chiavari&quot; is a style, not a brand name. That's why you will see so much quality variation out there in the market. Most companies are just resellers looking for product to sell at the cheapest price.</p>

        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p><strong>We are the factory</strong></p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>Because our  factories produce exclusively for us, we can maintain a very low defect rate  (significantly lower than others in the industry!) providing you a  nicer-looking, stronger and more usable chair to last for years.</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p><strong>We are the ONLY company to offer our exclusive  12-Point Quality Assurance Inspection</strong></p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>The inspection is performed on every chair virtually eliminates your risk of receiving  chairs that are produced poorly with bad wood joints or improper finishes. For  example, with our chairs you will not have to re-glue the joints or paint the  chairs when they arrive, thus eliminating hidden maintenance costs AFTER your  purchase. </p>
