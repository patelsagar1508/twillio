        <p>Each brand of Chiavari Chairs is created differently. Since <a href="history.php">Chiavari</a> is a particular style of chair which originated long ago in Chiavari, Italy, there are many variations between brands- some of them harder to recognize than others. Take a look at the chart on our main <a href="wholesale-chiavari-chairs.php">Chiavari Chairs</a> page and please refer to the questions below for specific answers to common questions.</p>

                    What is the main difference between Vision Furniture's Chiavari Cushion?
                </div>
                <div class="accordionContent"><div class="accordion_a"></div>
                <div class="ans_text">
                    <div class="float_l">All of Vision Furniture's Chiavari Cushions are built with the same reliability standard: You would expect our foam to be resilient and long lasting; that the cushion stitching is such that the ties, zipper and seams don't rip with normal usage and that you can wash the covers and reuse them many times. </div>
                    <div class="height5"></div>
                    <div class="float_l">I am sure that many of you that are reading this posting may be familiar with cushions that go flat too quickly or whose ties and zippers break after the first use or first wash. Much of the Chiavari Cushion market is plagued by these unreliable products. </div>
                    <div class="height5"></div>
                    <div class="float_l">All of our cushions, whether they are in stock or custom produced, are produced with the same standard. </div>
                </div>

                    Should I choose Velcro or Ties for my cushions? 
                </div>
                <div class="accordionContent"><div class="accordion_a"></div>
                    <div class="ans_text">
                        <div class="float_l">At Vision Furniture, we recommend tie back cushions because we feel they offer a more elegant presentation and, they hold up better in the wash and snag fabrics and, personally when you need to install a 1000 cushions, ties are easier on the hands than Velcro. </div>
                        <div class="height5"></div>
                        <div class="float_l">However, others enjoy Velcro because of the clean look of Velcro and, if the cushion will stay on the chair for a long period of time, Velcro will most likely stay in position a little better with Ties which may loosen up. </div>
                    </div>

                    Do I need a Chiavari Chair Cushion?

                <div class="accordionContent"><div class="accordion_a"></div>
                    <div class="ans_text">
                        <div class="float_l">You don't need a cushion for your Chiavari Chairs, but I highly recommend one. Not only does the cushion make the chair more comfortable, but it also has a design element because it breaks up the color of the chair and makes the whole package more visually Interesting.</div>
                        <div class="height5"></div>
                        <div class="float_l">A Mahogany Chiavari Chair with an Ivory cushion put next to a table with an off white linen is much more visually appealing than a chair without a cushion. </div>
                        <div class="height5"></div>
                        <div class="float_l">And yes, having a cushion requires some maintenance work for cleaning, etc, but this is just like any linen in your business. Your clients will expect clean cushions. Also, our cushions are double sided, so if one side is dirty, just turn it over and use the other side. </div>
                        <div class="height5"></div>
                        <div class="float_l">To help with maintenance, our cushions have a stain resistant finish to repel stains and you can easily wash them in warm water with normal detergent and a normal washer and drier. And, our product is sewn well to hold up to commercial use. </div>

                    What is a Slip Cover?

                <div class="accordionContent"><div class="accordion_a"></div>
                    <div class="ans_text">
                        <div class="float_l">A slip cover is a type of cushion cover that quickly slides over an existing cushion to change its color.</div>
                        <div class="height5"></div>
                        <div class="float_l">Some companies like to just use slip covers over their old cushions, because they are so easy to put on and take off and you can change colors easily. And, since the covers use an envelope opening in the bottom, there is no zipper to deal with. </div>
                        <div class="height5"></div>
                        <div class="float_l">We stock slip covers in our standard colors and custom colors are available for special order.</div>

                    Which cushion is easiest to maintain if I don't want to wash the fabric covers?
                </div>
                <div class="accordionContent"><div class="accordion_a"></div>
                    <div class="ans_text">
                        <div class="float_l">For the cushion with the lowest maintenance costs where you won't have to wash the fabric cover, I would suggest a cushion produced with Vinyl or synthetic leather. We stock a smooth grain synthetic leather cushion in off White or Black Vinyl that is very easy to clean. You just wipe it down if it is dirty with a damp towel. </div>
                        <div class="height5"></div>
                        <div class="float_l">The vinyl cushion is currently available as a Panel Board Cushion only but, we can also sew Vinyl Cushions in the style as the standard cushion with piping for special order.</div>

                <div class="accordionContent"><div class="accordion_a"></div>
                    <div class="ans_text">
                        <div class="float_l">Firstly all Vision Furniture classic cushions are treated with a stain resistant finish that is similar to the scotch guard so stains from some items such as wine, soda, coffee may not set instantly and may be easier to remove by wiping the fabric down with a damp towel. </div>

                    How to I wash and maintain my Chiavari Cushions?

                        <div class="float_l">Our classic cushions have a zipper back so you can remove the cushion foam and wash the fabric cover. Since most of our covers are 100% polyester, they can me washed on medium heat with a good detergent and tumble dry on medium or high. </div>
                        <div class="height5"></div>
                        <div class="float_l">Remember to close the velcros prior to washing because they could snag the fabric and, close the zippers too for less wear and tear.</div>

                        <div class="float_l">Wrinkled covers can be steam ironed with medium heat.</div>

                        <div class="float_l">To put the foam back into the covers, use a cushion sheath, plastic bag or purchase a mesh sleeve that you can keep on your foams for ease of taking the cushion cover on and off. </div>

                    <div class="ans_text">
                        <div class="float_l">Foam can be difficult to put back inside the cushion cover without the right tools because the foam has lots of friction against the fabric making it difficult to maneuver. You can solve this problem with our plastic cushion sheath, a plastic bag or with one of our mesh cushion sleeves. All will make putting the foam back into the cover easier. </div>
                        <div class="height5"></div>
                        <div class="float_l">Also, remember to insert the foam as a roll and let it open up firstly and go into position before removing the sheath. </div>

                        <div class="float_l">A panel board cushion is basically a wood type board that is upholstered with Foam and fabric. This style of cushion is very popular with leathers and vinyl because the fabric covers does not come off as it is stapled to the board. </div>

                        <div class="float_l">If you choose this cushion, Velcro will need to be installed onto the seat tops. The bottom side of the board cushion also has velcro so when it is pressed to the seat top, the cushion becomes attached. </div>

                        <div class="float_l">And, it is not a problem to stack the chairs with the vinyl cushion, but have caution when stacking too high or leaving the chairs stacked with the cushion for long periods of time because of the chance that the foam will get worn in the cushion areas that have spindle pressure. </div>
