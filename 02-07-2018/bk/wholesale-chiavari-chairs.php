                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Many companies skip this important step to save money on labor costs but <a href="blog/best-chiavari-chairs-quality-inspection/" target="_blank">inspecting each Chiavari Chair before it leaves our warehouse</a> is crucial to ensure that you are getting our best chairs. We put in the extra effort so the chairs we send out are safe and beautiful. Every chair is thoroughly inspected and then packaged with the proper packing materials to safeguard your chairs during shipping. This mean you get a better-quality product, thus requiring less repairs and maintenance after delivery.</p>

                     <p style="text-align: justify;">Our chair glides are durable! We use a quality plastic designed to withstand heavy daily use. The last thing you want is for the plastic to break, exposing a dangerous, sharp nail that could damage floors. Another important detail often overlooked is the ability to move the chair in and out from under the table, while sitting. Your guests' safety is very important - our glides move smoothly across a variety of floor surfaces.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your events depend on beautiful, reliable décor and that's why you chose Chiavari Chairs. <a href="/blog/quality-wooden-chiavari-chairs-vf/" target="_blank">We hand-select quality wood</a> which is clear from defects like cracks and worm holes. The elegance of a natural material like wood brings a warmth and sophistication to your venue. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, we have specially formulated our paints and finishes so they are consistent in color and are easy to maintain over the life of your chairs. Some companies use cheap paints which can chip and flake. We use a <a href="/blog/buy-wholesale-chiavari-chair-accessories/" target="_blank">high-quality lacquer</a> which chemically bonds with the previously applied layer, forming a thick, smooth and durable surface.</p>

                    <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Many cheap Chiavari Chair manufacturers use cheap bolts made with soft metals that easily strip – leaving you unable to tighten you bolts. Proper maintenance is critical to providing safe and reliable seating for your guests. Without good bolts, you won't be able to maintain your chairs! At Vision we use high-density steel bolts that don't strip when you tighten them- so you will be able to properly maintain your chairs long-term. <a href="/blog/maintain-chiavari-chairs/" target="_blank">Learn more about maintaining your chairs.</a></p>

                    <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">We have tested different Chiavari Chair materials including resin/steel/aluminum and have found <a href="/blog/quality-wooden-chiavari-chairs-vf/" target="_blank">Wood Chiavari Chairs to be far superior in many ways.</a></p>
                    
                    <ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">Natural Finishes - Resin Chiavari Chairs that are meant to look like wood only end up looking cheap. It's impossible to achieve an authentic wood look when working with metal or plastic.  </li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">Easy Maintenance - Because of the type of paints/finishes used on wood Chiavari Chairs, you can touch up your chairs easily. Touch up kits are available in all paint finishes.</li>
                        <li style="text-align: justify;">Safety - Wood chairs will 'warn' you by loosening slightly prior to potentially breaking. This allows you to inspect and fix the chair by tightening the bolts or to replace the chair in advance of an accident. Both resin and metal chairs break without warning. </li>

This makes it easy to field-test our products to find out what works and what doesn't. Over the years we have found our product’s weaknesses and made modifications to continually improve quality. Our expertise means our chairs are thoughtfully designed and are built to withstand heavy use.</p>

            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">Vision Furniture by far exceeds industry standards in regards to customer service and quality products. I’ve purchased Chiavari chairs, Chiavari bar stools and chair cushions from this company. I had a bad experience previously buying Chiavari chairs through a supply broker and when I first found Vision Furniture online I was skeptical. When I called their customer service department couldn’t have been kinder or more efficient. The sales representative I spoke to completely understood my concerns, and was more than happy to ship me a single chair to inspect for quality and durability. They made the entire process a pleasant one. I have recommended them to a few other local businesses and will continue to buy from them for years to come.</div>
