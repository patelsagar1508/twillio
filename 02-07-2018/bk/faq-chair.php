                            <li>We have had real success with our factory to produce consistent and reliable wood Chairs. </li>
                            <li>Wood has a great look and feel that lends itself well to elegant settings.</li>
                            <li>Wood chairs are easy to repair and maintain with inexpensive touchup products. All event products will have wear and tear so it is very important to know how to maintain them.</li>
                            <li>Wood Chairs can last indefinitely, this means 10+ years if maintained and we have clients that are still using their chairs from 2004.</li>
                            <li>In product testing, especially in chair back durability testing, our chair joints have been tested to be 2,400% more durable than metal or resin Chiavari Chairs tested. Those chairs are not reliable.</li>
                            <li>The main problem with Generic Wood, Metal and Resin Chiavari Chairs is that most factories are producing their products to such low price levels that it is impossible to have reliability and integrity at those prices so at this time, a Vision Furniture brand wood chair offers a complete package to our customers.</li>

                     What is the difference between Acrylic vs. Polycarbonate?
                </div>
                <div class="accordionContent"><div class="accordion_a"></div>
                    <div class="ans_text">
                        <div class="float_l">Some people are calling this style of clear chair an Acrylic chair, but this is incorrect unless the chair is actually made of Acrylic plastic. Acrylic refers to the specific type of plastic used in Plexiglas. It is a clear thermoplastic that is heavier than polycarbonate and also less impact resistant. Our transparent Chiavari chairs are made with polycarbonate plastic.</div>
                        <div class="height5"></div>
                        <div class="float_l">There are several reasons why Polycarbonate is a better material to use for Chiavari Chairs. Acrylic does tend to be cheaper because the material is inexpensive and it is a little easier to work with in terms of molding it into shape. Acrylic however, is more likely to chip because it has less impact resistance than Polycarbonate. Polycarbonate, on the other hand, is the preferred material by the government and other agencies where strength and integrity is important. It is used in bulletproof windows and even the cockpit windows for fighter jets. Because of its superior qualities, polycarbonate does cost more to produce and work with.</div>
                        <div class="height5"></div>
                        <div class="float_l">We use 100% Virgin Polycarbonate polymer because of the many properties that make it the right choice for our chairs. It makes for a beautiful chair and is a great complement in your contemporary design.</div>
