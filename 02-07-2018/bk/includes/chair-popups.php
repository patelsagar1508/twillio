			<h2>Year Three Is Just As Important<br/>As Day One.</h2>
			<div class="spacer_height10"></div>
			<p>With the rental side of our business, we have the ability to field-test our product to find out what works, and what doesn't work.

				<li>Upgraded chair glides (feet) - Won't damage floors</li>
				<li>High-grade hardware - You won't strip the bolts</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A lot of thought has been put into our chairs over the years- and we continue to make improvements all the time. Once you see the difference, you'll never go anywhere else!</p>

		   <h2>Wood, Carpet, Laminate, etc... All Safe!</h2>
		   <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
			 <p><strong>Our quality chair clides are tough!</strong> We use a dense plastic designed to withstand heavy, daily use. The last thing you want is for the plastic to break, exposing a dangerously sharp nail! Many companies cut corners by using cheap chair glides. They figure, &quot;It's on the bottom of the chair, no one will notice.&quot; You'll definitely notice after a nail cuts through your expensive flooring!</p>
			 <p>Another important detail often overlooked is the ability to move the chair in and out from under the table, while sitting. Your guests' safety is very important- if they cannot move their chairs smoothly, they may tip over and fall! <span class="bold">Our glides move smoothly across a variety of floor surfaces from carpet to linoleum to wood and others.</span></p>

			<h2>Chairs That Make You Look Good</h2>
			<div class="spacer_height10"></div>
			<p>Your events depend on fantastic, reliable decor, that's why you chose the Chiavari Chair in the first place.</p>
			<p>We hand-select good quality wood which is clear from defects like cracks and  worm holes. In order to save money and cut corners, other companies simply fill holes with putty and paint over it- leaving you with a chair structure that is not as strong as it should be.</p>
			<p>We have specially formulated our paints and finishes so they are consistent in color and are easy to maintain over the lifetime of your chairs. Some companies use a cheaper polyurethane which can chip and flake off through use. Instead, we use a high-quality lacquer which chemically bonds with the previously applied layer, forming a thick, durable and consistently beautiful surface.</p>

			<h2>Ever  Frustrated By A Stripped Bolt?</h2>
			<div class="spacer_height10"></div>
			<p><strong>The reason for this is</strong> because cheaper, softer metals are commonly used to bring costs down. It's far to easy to sell a cheap product that doesn't hold up over time- and you will often find this with cheap, $30 chiavari chairs.</p>
			<p>Proper maintenance is critical to providing safe and reliable seating for your guests. Without good bolts, you won't be able to maintain your chairs!</p>
			<p><strong>We use <em>only</em> upgraded high-density steel bolts.</strong> They don't strip when you tighten them- so you will be able to properly maintain your chairs for a long time. </p>

			<h2>Benefits of Real, Solid Wood</h2>
			<div class="spacer_height10"></div>
			<p>(vs. resin or metal)</p>
			<p>We have tested different types of material including resin and aluminum and have found <strong>Wood Chiavari Chairs</strong> to be far superior in many ways.</p>
			<p>This is what we have found:</p>
			<ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 1em;">
				<li><strong>Natural Finishes</strong> - Resin chiavari chairs that are meant to look like wood only end up looking cheap. It's impossible to achieve an authentic wood look when working with metal or plastic. The wood grains that add to the overall aesthetic of the chair are nonexistent. <a href="chair-mahogany.php">Mahogany</a> is one of our most popular finishes and can only be found with Wood. </li>
				<li><strong>Easy Maintenance</strong> - Because of the type of paints/finishes used on wood chiavari chairs, you can touch up your chairs much more easily than others. Touch up kits are available in all paint finishes.</li>
				<li><strong>Stays Safer Longer</strong> - Wood chairs will 'warn' you  by loosening  prior to potentially breaking. This allows you to inspect and fix or replace the chairs in advance of an accident. Both resin and metal chairs simply break right away.</li>
