            <h3 class="page_head3">Why Choose Vinyl?</h3>
	        <div class="float_l">Vinyl is the perfect balance between aesthetics and function. Our high quality vinyl has a buttery look and feel that is a good substitute for leather. Vinyl is also extremely easy to keep up because of the stain resistant and almost waterproof nature of the material. If soiled the cushions just need to be wiped down with a soft, damp cloth.</div>

	        <h3 class="page_head3">Vinyl Chiavari Board Cushions</h3>
	        <div class="float_l">Vision Vinyl Board Cushions provide a more permanent look for your Chiavari Chairs and attach directly to the Chiavari Chair seat top using Velcro. These hard back cushions are made to fit all Vision Furniture Chiavari Chairs as well as some off-brand Chiavari Chairs. The cushions feature high density internal foam that is upholstered with a soft synthetic leather that is durable and easy to maintain. When purchasing the cushions and chairs together, we will install the Velcro to the seat for you. If purchasing only cushions then your staff can install the cushions with Velcro that we will provide.</div>
