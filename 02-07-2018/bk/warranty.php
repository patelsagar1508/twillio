        <h3 class="page_head3">WARRANTY:</h3>
        <p>Vision Furniture offers a 24 month limited warranty covering manufacturing defects on our BIFMA Chiavari Chair frames. Please <a href="https://www.chiavarichairs.com/blog/chiavari-chair-warranty/" target="_blank">see our warranty blog for additional details</a> . </P>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <h3 class="page_head3">BUYER BEWARE-</h3>
        <P> Always be wary of cheap Chiavari chairs with long warranties of 5+ years. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Cheap chairs with unrealistically long warranties are there to mislead customers and to sell poorly made chairs fast. The problem is, when you need the warranty, these companies won’t service it. Remember, even Apple who sells expensive iPhones for hundreds of dollars only offers a 1 year limited warranty. At Vision Furniture we offer a fair warranty that covers any issue that might arise from manufacturing defects in the first 2 years</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
