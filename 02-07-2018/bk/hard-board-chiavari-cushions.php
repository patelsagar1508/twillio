            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">As an outdoor, garden wedding venue in Hawaii, finding quality furniture and decor can be tricky. We actually had cushions for our Chiavari chairs, but removed them because the weather just totally ruined the cushions, and they just didn't last- they were flat, torn and dirty. I spent some time doing my research to find a cushion that would last, and not end up like our old ones stored away. When I came across Vision Furniture, I knew right away that these were the ones we needed- HD foam cushions, stain resistant fabric and even quality threading too! So many color options, zipper closure, tie or Velcro, I knew they would be perfect for our open air Chapel. I emailed for a quote and got a response within a matter of an hour or two, including shipping and handling charges all the way to Hawaii. Beautiful, quality products AND quick, polite customer service, and we were sold- no convincing was needed to get the approval to purchase from our owner. We purchased that same day and received our shipment within a week. Being in Hawaii, not everything arrives that quickly. The packaging was great, and I was more impressed then I expected when I opened it! The cushions are the perfect addition our venue needed and I couldn't have selected a better product. They hold up extremely well in our weather, have stayed clean as promised, and are still so comfy after having hundreds of people sit on them. I couldn't be more satisfied with this purchase, and I will never have to research where to get these amazing cushions again! Mahalo Vision Furniture for making a difference for our venue and for our couples!    </div>

        <h4 class="page_head4">Things to Consider:</h4> 
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Though our cushions use excellent quality foam, we don't recommend keeping your chairs stacked on top of these board cushions for long periods of time because the stacking weight over time may lead to impression marks and reduced foam resilience. For short periods of stacking, you can stack up to 6 chairs high without much risk. If you are putting your chairs away for the off season, we recommend removing the cushions and stack the chairs wood-on-wood.</li>
          <li>Though the cushions are easy to clean from most event debris (such as coffee, wine, gravy, etc.)with just a damp cloth, some heavy dyes from shoes, inks, certain clothing, etc. could cause a stain that requires extra cleaning.</li>
          <li><b>NOTICE:</b> Vision Furniture Cushions meet all flammability requirements of California Bureau of Home Furnishings Bulletins 117. Care should be exercised near open flame or with burning cigarettes.</li>
