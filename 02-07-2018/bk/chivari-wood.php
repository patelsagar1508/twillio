        <div class="breadcrumbs"><a href="/">Home</a><span class="breadcrumbs-arrow"></span>Why use wood?</div>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <h2 class="page_head2">1) Elegant Style</h2>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>While metal chairs can feel cold and stiff, and resin chairs often look cheap and sway too much, Wood  Chiavari Chairs have a rich, elegant feel that complements fine events.</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <h2 class="page_head2">2) Some colors  are only available for wood</h2>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>Finishes such as <strong>Mahogany, Fruitwood, Walnut,  and Natural</strong> are often desirable because they bring out the beauty of the wood. It's obvious that metal and resin could never reproduce the dimension and depth that your guests love. We use only commercial-grade paints, finishes, and laquers to give you lasting beauty.</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <h2 class="page_head2">3) Super-Durable</h2>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>Our  chairs are built to last and our product passes 5 BIFMA 5.1 seating tests  produced especially for commercial chairs. <u>In certain tests our wood chair back  lasted 1,000%+ longer than certain resin Chiavari chairs during a chair back durability  test.</u></p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <h2 class="page_head2">4) Easy to maintain</h2>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>It's simple to repair and touch up a wood chair with our maintenance kit. <span class="defination">Therefore, wood chairs can have a very long life with  proper maintenance and care</span>.</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>Metal chairs usually require welding   when the joints loosen and metal can dent easily when hit.</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>Resin is  difficult to clean because dirt and stains can become trapped in scratches on the surface of the chair. Once a resin chair is cracked, it becomes completely unusable, and depending on the design and raw materials used, they can become weak and crack without warning.</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <h2 class="page_head2">5) Wood Chairs  give advance warning before breaking</h2>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p><strong>This is an important feature you do not find with Resin and Metal Chiavari Chairs:</strong></p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>If a wood chair is to be a dangerous chair, the chair becomes wobbly, creaky, and the joints start to come loose. This is great news for you because these advance warning signs are an opportunity to service your chairs <em>before</em> they cause harm to anyone.</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>Other materials such as resin can break and snap without this advance warning; this is called Catastrophic Failure. </p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p><strong>The ability to recognize advance warning signs of chair deterioration are important for companies who want to ensure  they are providing safe seating for their customers.</strong></p>
