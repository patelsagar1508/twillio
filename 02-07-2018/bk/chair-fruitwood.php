        <p>Our Fruitwood Chiavari Chair is a golden honey color similar to natural cherry stain. Our clients enjoy its elegant and natural color. Fruitwood is a very light stain, compared to our <a href="chair-mahogany.php">Mahogany Chiavari Chairs</a>, the darkest of our four wood finishes.</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>With cheap chiavari chairs from other companies, you will often find an opaque and lifeless finish. They will often  have a purple undertone, have a rough surface with not enough lacquer making the chair look dry  and lifeless. We make sure our product is properly made and finished before we ship to any of our clients.         </p>

            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">Vision Furniture is the best in so many ways.  Four years ago I was lucky enough to order White Resin Folding Chairs and Fruitwood Chiavari Chairs for our vineyard where we do numerous weddings a year.  We are entering our 4th year and all the chairs are in terrific condition!  The White Resin Folding Chairs hold up to outdoor weather conditions.  Ours have been in the rain and humid conditions and the pads still look brand new.  Any that have gotten damaged by a guest were very easy to replace.  All I had to do was call Sonya and she would quickly send me a new pad to pop in myself.  The cushions I have for the Chiavari Chairs have Velcro fasteners.  We take them on and off after every event (around 60 a year) and they have held up just fine.  The covers come off easily from the cushions which allows for easy cleaning in my home washing machine.  The durability of the Chiavari Chairs is awesome!  We have had some weddings where the bride and groom are lifted in these chairs and have had no problem with ever having a leg or back of the chair break.  What I like best about Vision Furniture is their customer service.  Whenever I call to order more items, Sonya always remembers me and takes such great care of me.  I can't say enough good things about Vision Furniture.  Highly recommend and personally continue to use them.</div>

        <p>Using a natural acacia wood chair frame is the only way to achieve a true and beautiful finish. Metal and Aluminum Chiavari Chairs simply don't have that ability!</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>We use several coats of high-quality lacquer to properly seal the wood with a transparent and natural-looking finish. Polyurethane is  a more common finish because it is cheaper, but it is much more difficult to maintain over time because it will peel. Polyurethane does not share the same characteristics as laquer because it does not &quot;amalgamate&quot; (bind together) to the primary coat so you cannot apply multiple coats to the chair.</p>
