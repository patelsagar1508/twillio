        <p>Our Natural Chiavari Chair is produced with raw Acacia wood and finished with a light color natural stain with a clear coat. It has a uniquely natural, festive look that is that perfect complement to a rustic design or less formal occastions. The color is the lightest of our four wood grain finishes. The next lightest is our <a href="chair-fruitwood.php">Fruitwood Chiavari Chair</a> and the darkest is our <a href="chair-mahogany.php">Mahogany Chiavari Chair</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>There is natural wood color variation in the chair which gives our frame its distinctive and rustically elegant character.</strong></p>

        <p>A natural wood chair frame is the best option for a walnut chair because our wood's ability to take stain and produce a finish with dimension and real wood grain. We use a solid wood chair frame that is very strong and durable because we produce our frames properly with high Quality Control steps at each stage of production. Our wood frames are tested to real furniture BIFMA testing standards.</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>With other cheap chiavari chairs, you will often find an opaque and lifeless finish. They will often be too dark and have a rough surface without enough lacquer making the chair look dry  and lifeless. We make sure our product is properly made and finished before we ship to any of our clients.</p>

        <p>Using a natural wood chair frame is the only way to achieve a true and beautiful finish. Metal and Aluminum Chiavari Chairs simply don't have that ability!</p>
        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
        <p>We use several coats of high-quality lacquer to properly seal the wood with a transparent and natural-looking finish. Polyurethane is  a more common finish because it is cheaper, but it is much more difficult to maintain over time because it will peel. Polyurethane does not share the same characteristics as laquer because it does not &quot;amalgamate&quot; (bind together) to the primary coat so you cannot apply multiple coats to the chair.</p>

            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">We purchased our Natural finish Chiavari Chairs about one year ago, March 2014, to place in our new event space that we built next to our winery/tasting room in Scott Twp., PA.  The reps at Vision Furniture were extremely helpful and the chairs are absolutely beautiful! We opted for the removable cushions in Ivory, which we were a little skeptical on how they would hold up, but they washed well and did not hold stains, nor did they shrink! We are very pleased and in fact will be calling for more in the Natural finish and some in the Mahogany finish for our tasting room!</div>
