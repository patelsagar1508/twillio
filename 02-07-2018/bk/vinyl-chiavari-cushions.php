            <h3 class="page_head3">Why Choose Vinyl for your Chiavari Cushions?</h3>
	        <div class="float_l">Vinyl is the perfect balance between aesthetics and function. Our high performance vinyl has a buttery look and feel that is a good substitute for leather. Our vinyl is also extremely easy to keep up because of the stain resistant and almost waterproof nature of the material. If soiled, the cushions just need to be wiped down with a soft, damp cloth.</div>
	        <div class="spacer_height10"></div>
	        <div class="float_l"><b>For Example:</b> a poorly made vinyl with unstable ingredients can react with the lacquer finish on a Chiavari chair if the cushion is left on for long periods of time or left on while the chairs are stacked. This can leave permanent staining on the cushions and compromise the finish on the Chiavari Chairs. If the finish on a Chiavari Chair is softened by a chemical reaction with a cheap vinyl then this can lead to further staining of guestâ€™s clothes or other cushions that come in contact with the chair. To avoid these problems we use an upgraded vinyl that is made from ONLY polyurethane (PU) and no unstable components. </div>

	        <h3 class="page_head3">Vinyl Chiavari Board Cushions</h3>
	        <div class="float_l">Vision Vinyl Board Cushions provide a more permanent look for your Chiavari Chairs and attach directly to the Chiavari Chair seat top using Velcro. These hard back cushions are made to fit all Vision Furniture Chiavari Chairs as well as some off-brand Chiavari Chairs. The cushions feature high density internal foam that is upholstered with a soft, performance vinyl that is durable and easy to maintain. When purchasing the cushions and chair frames together, we will install the Velcro onto to the seat for you before shipping. If purchasing only board cushions then we will provide additional Velcro so that your staff can install it onto the seat of your chairs. </div>

            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">We absolutely LOVE our new Off-White Vinyl Chiavari Board Cushions! We tested them out as soon as they arrived, we made a large ink stain and it truly did just wipe right off! The cushions are very comfortable to sit on and do not sink in and slowly rise after you get up like many of the other cheaper vinyl cushions do. We loved the cushions so much that we decided to purchase an additional 100 after our initial purchase so we could have them at all times in every area of our venue! It is an investment, but we feel it was a very wise purchase and our brides have all raved about and are very pleased with the change from the cloth cushions we had prior. Jim and all of the other employees at Vision Furniture have been extremely helpful and given us excellent customer service!</div>
