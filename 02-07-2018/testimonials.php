            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">We recently purchased several dozen Ivory Cushion Covers for our Chiavari Chairs to replace a much inferior product. The colors matched perfectly with the design of our room, and fit great over our pre-existing foam inserts. We can already tell the quality is far superior to what we previously used. We also purchased the Chiavari Chair Dolly and the ease of use has saved our company countless man hours when setting up and breaking down our event space. Can't recommend Vision Furniture enough, not to mention the excellent customer service!

            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">We have experienced wooden Chiavari Chairs in the past and switched to resin at one property and aluminum at another because the wooden chairs did not stand up and would often squeak. However, the look of both resin and aluminum do not compare to wood.
<br><br>Fortunately we found Vision Furniture who offered <a href="chair-champagne.php" target="_blank">a superior quality Chiavari Chair made from wood and also offered champagne as the colour choice which our clients love.</a> We have now purchased over 1500 chivari chairs from Vision Furniture. Both the quality and service are unsurpassed. The vinyl of the cushions is also elegant and very easy to maintain. The service is also exceptional. Response rates are always timely and delivery dates are met without delays. It’s a relief to find a company that acts more like a partner and wants to provide the best in quality and service. That’s a company you keep coming back to.</div>

In each and every instance, the VISION ordering process, deliveries and pick-ups were FAST, CONCISE and ever so KIND. In the Event Business you dearly need ALL THAT!

            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">I stumbled across Vision Furniture online when I was looking to order a large number of White Folding Chairs.  In comparing various companies, I was immediately struck by the quality of Vision as their chairs are solid core folding chairs, as opposed to more inexpensive hollow core chairs, which can twist under greater weight, suffer from sun exposure, and generally are much lower quality.  The Vision folding chairs are made in America as well, which is a plus these days.
<br><br>My sales rep was Jim Hess,  who was most helpful and sent me a chair to test, as well as a cross section of the solid core construction material.  I (and my client) were immediately sold.  They also sell compact carts on which to load the chairs. Yes, they cost a few dollars more,  but they will outlast and outperform any cheaper chair you might choose.  They arrived within a week,  were completely as advertised and represented,  and I (and my client) could not be happier. I heartily recommend this company and Jim Hess.</div>

The cushions are very comfortable to sit on and do not sink in and slowly rise after you get up like many of the other cheaper vinyl cushions do. We loved the cushions so much that we decided to purchase an additional 100 after our initial purchase so we could have them at all times in every area of our venue! It is an investment, but we feel it was a very wise purchase and our brides have all raved about and are very pleased with the change from the cloth cushions we had prior. Jim and all of the other employees at Vision Furniture have been extremely helpful and given us excellent customer service!</div>

            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">We obtained sample Chiavari chairs from six different vendors, and we are so glad we went to that trouble. The chair from Vision Furniture was the only one that was comfortable to sit in. All the rest had backs that were at a right angle to the seats--very uncomfortable. A close examination of the chairs also revealed that the chair from Vision Furniture was much better made and had a cleaner, smoother finish. The mahogany color was also more to our liking--a rich brown with a reddish tone, rather than the more garish red of the others. Although it is a more expensive chair, it is worth it.<br /><br />We did have a problem with the vinyl on the board cushions. Apparently, there was a bad batch of vinyl that stained easily. But Anthony replaced all 350 cushions right away, at no charge to us, as soon as the problem was discovered, and the new cushions are fine. That's the kind of service you wish you got from every vendor you deal with. It seems to us that Vision Furniture is going the extra mile to make a better chair and provide great customer service.</div>

Four years ago I was lucky enough to order White Resin Folding Chairs and <a href="https://www.chiavarichairs.com/chair-fruitwood.php">Fruitwood Chiavari Chairs for our vineyard where we do numerous weddings a year.</a>  We are entering our 4th year and all the chairs are in terrific condition!  The White Resin Folding Chairs hold up to outdoor weather conditions.  Ours have been in the rain and humid conditions and the pads still look brand new.  Any that have gotten damaged by a guest were very easy to replace.  All I had to do was call Sonya and she would quickly send me a new pad to pop in myself.  The cushions I have for the Chiavari Chairs have Velcro fasteners.  We take them on and off after every event (around 60 a year) and they have held up just fine.  The covers come off easily from the cushions which allows for easy cleaning in my home washing machine.  The durability of the Chiavari Chairs is awesome!  We have had some weddings where the bride and groom are lifted in these chairs and have had no problem with ever having a leg or back of the chair break.  What I like best about Vision Furniture is their customer service.  Whenever I call to order more items, Sonya always remembers me and takes such great care of me.  I can't say enough good things about Vision Furniture.  Highly recommend and personally continue to use them.</div>

I received many samples and sub-rented numerous times over the years from providers from Washington, D.C. to New York before deciding on where to purchase our Chiavari Chairs. The quality products and outstanding service that Anthony and Sonya provide through Vision Furniture are unbeatable. I can always depend on Vision Furniture for the highest quality chair to meet the needs of my clients.</div>

We wanted a chair that would not only look great and change the entire look of a space, but also be safe and comfortable for our clients and their guests. After renting our more than 800 Gold, Silver, Mahogany and Natural Chiavari Chairs from Vision Furniture for the past year, I would say that have passed that test and impressed all of our clients. Not only is it nice to buy from a fellow Pennsylvanian Company, but it is also great doing business with people who understand the value of good customer service, are fair with their pricing and appreciate your business as well.</div>

Thankfully, with the help of our credit card company, we were able to have our payment returned.  By the way, the one sample chair we received from CT Direct has not held up well and it sits in our office and is rarely used. So back to searching.  We had considered Vision Furniture before, but their cost was a little more.  Lesson learned, you get what you pay for.<br />

         Our experience with Vision Furniture has been very easy and professional from the beginning.  Their customer service has been exemplary.  We ordered 400 mahogany Chiavari Chairs with black cushions.   We received our shipment quickly.   They have withstood over 200 wedding receptions and still look as beautiful as the day we bought them.

            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">As an outdoor, garden wedding venue in Hawaii, finding quality furniture and decor can be tricky. We actually had cushions for our Chiavari chairs, but removed them because the weather just totally ruined the cushions, and they just didn't last- they were flat, torn and dirty. I spent some time doing my research to find a cushion that would last, and not end up like our old ones stored away. When I came across Vision Furniture, I knew right away that these were the ones we needed- HD foam cushions, stain resistant fabric and even quality threading too! So many color options, zipper closure, tie or Velcro, I knew they would be perfect for our open air Chapel. I emailed for a quote and got a response within a matter of an hour or two, including shipping and handling charges all the way to Hawaii. Beautiful, quality products AND quick, polite customer service, and we were sold- no convincing was needed to get the approval to purchase from our owner. We purchased that same day and received our shipment within a week. Being in Hawaii, not everything arrives that quickly. The packaging was great, and I was more impressed then I expected when I opened it! The cushions are the perfect addition our venue needed and I couldn't have selected a better product. They hold up extremely well in our weather, have stayed clean as promised, and are still so comfy after having hundreds of people sit on them. I couldn't be more satisfied with this purchase, and I will never have to research where to get these amazing cushions again! Mahalo Vision Furniture for making a difference for our venue and for our couples!    </div>

            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">Being in a small market in Northeast PA, I spent considerable time and effort researching Chiavari Chairs before making the plunge and investing in my own inventory. I received many samples and sub-rented numerous times over the years from providers from Washington, D.C. to New York before deciding on where to purchase our Chiavari Chairs. The quality products and outstanding service that Anthony and Sonya provide through Vision Furniture are unbeatable. I can always depend on Vision Furniture for the highest quality chair to meet the needs of my clients.</div>

Then, thinking I had to pay more for quality, I ordered from Ballard (no exaggeration: 9x the price of these) but thankfully the color wasn’t right. Determined to find what I needed at any price, I stumbled upon these via Google. Surprised that I could order fewer than 100 pcs, I placed my order and held my breath. THESE ARE PERFECT! Ivory is true ivory, not yellowish. The foam is very firm, so nobody in my family feels the seat through the cushion. Mfg quality is high, with nice zippers , sturdy ties and well-sewn seams. Vision even sent me emails with package tracking info! This was the perfect shopping experience PLUS the perfect items delivered. I would give 10 stars if I could. THANK YOU, Vision Furniture! I will be back.</div>

In order to add additional seating a decorator I know recommended these Chiavari Chairs. She entertains often and has used hers for the last 10 years. I ordered 6 and my sister ordered 6 as well. We have used them many times already throughout the holidays and occasionally borrowed additional from each other. They are narrow enough to allow maximum seating, as well as being sturdy and attractive. When not in use I can stack them and store them out of the way.  Stacked, they take up about the same amount of floor space as folding chairs. I love them.</div>

After reviewing other websites offering Chiavari Chairs, and seeing the quality of Chiavari Chairs available at local retailers, I wasn't satisfied with the durability of the chairs I saw and was somewhat suspect of "rock bottom" prices that were quoted on other websites. Once we located Vision Furniture's website, we were impressed with the quality of information and images provided on the Vision Furniture website.  Since I needed only 4 to 6 chairs, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to purchase them from a company that dealt in large volume orders.  When I requested a quote on the chairs I needed, I was treated with impeccable customer service and provided the information I needed quickly and efficiently.  The ordering process was smooth and easy with delivery made within the week of the order, all as promised. We were very impressed with the quality of construction and beauty of our new chairs. Our family has enjoyed many hours of board games and completing puzzles using our new chairs. I have no hesitation recommending Vision Furniture to anyone needing Chiavari Chairs.</div>

            <br><br>This is my second pair and I know I'll be ordering several more as time goes on because nothing, however well made, lasts forever! We are very happy customers and know you're the best.</div>

            <div class="quotebox-tab-text">Ordering from Vision Furniture was a very pleasant experience. We had no reservations having to order before even seeing samples; moreover Sonya and Anthony made it possible by encouraging us to visit their warehouse before ordering. We ordered by referrals from the "Special Event" vendor list and checking with the better business bureau. Everything we read about the company was great and they proved to be even better whiles working with them to receive the container load of Chiavari chairs and cushions we ordered. We received the load as described, very well packed with the cushions all wrapped up in plastic to avoid any damages. The chairs were of extremely good quality and stacked up which made it very easy to offload and use immediately. Our experience using Vision Furniture was just splendid. Kudos guys, communication with Sonya and Anthony was great and they followed up to make sure all our order arrived as stated.<br /><br />You guys give a whole new meaning to internet purchase. Thanks and you've got yourselves a customer for life.</div>

They made me feel comfortable with the transaction from the get-go.<br />The chairs were delivered in good condition as they promised, with all the extra equipments we agreed, the chairs were of excellent wood quality, so were the cushions (water and stain proof). What really got me was the honesty, sincerity and above all the immaculate customer service I got. Vision Furniture helped me to achieve my quest and I was able to perform the whole transaction from the United Kingdom.<br />I was indeed very pleased with the transaction and I must say it couldn’t have been done in a better way</div>
