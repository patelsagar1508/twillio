Not only are their comfortable, but they also add a modern, clean feel to the place where we meet all of our potential wedding couples. Definitely a smart purchase and worth every penny!</div>

	<div class="full-text">The gold Chiavari chairs we ordered from Vision Furniture are sturdy, comfortable, and stunning. As a struggling nonprofit organization, we appreciate the great customer service, fair pricing, and speedy shipment of the chairs. Our visitors cannot believe how comfortable the cushions are. And as events coordinator for AHA, I am pleased that the chairs not only serve their purpose well but also blend nicely with our period decor.</div>

	<div class="full-text">Thanks for another great shipment of Mahogany Chiavari chairs! They continue to be a popular item with our brides and the barstools are a great compliment to a cocktail party. I can always count on Vision Furniture to come thru with my last minute requests. We love your selection of chair pad covers, as we feel every wedding is unique, they allow a bride to bring together the color she has always dreamed of for her special day.</div>

	<div class="full-text">When we opened our new facility, we knew the look and feel of the Chiavari Chairs would reflect on the impression of the entire facility. We ordered sample chairs from three sources. Although the Vision chairs were a little more expensive, we liked then look, feel, and sturdiness of the Vision chairs. We could not be happier with our choice. They are sturdy, hold up well, and look great. We get compliments on the chairs on a regular basis.</div>

	<div class="full-text">Vision Furniture made the process of purchasing our Chiavari Chairs absolutely seamless.  On my first order I needed the chairs in a very short amount of time.  Not only did Vision deliver the chairs when promised, they were two days early.  The customer service team has a  level of professionalism that most companies dream of.  I would highly recommend Vision Furniture.</div>
